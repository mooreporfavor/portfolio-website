### Problem

Despite significant investments in workforce development programs, the Government of Morocco lacked robust evidence on which interventions were most effective at improving youth employment outcomes. There was a critical need for rigorous, evidence-based policy guidance to optimize public spending.

### Methodology

I conceptualized and co-led the establishment of the Morocco Employment Lab, a dedicated research and policy translation initiative.

   Data Collection & Analysis Facilitated partnerships with local research institutions and government ministries to access administrative data. Oversaw the design and implementation of multiple Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) to rigorously evaluate different labor market interventions (e.g., job search assistance, skills training, entrepreneurship support).
   Modeling & Technique Applied advanced econometric methods to analyze data from the RCTs, isolating the causal impact of various employment programs. This involved close collaboration with leading academics from Harvard's Evidence for Policy Design (EPOD) and MIT's Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL).
   Communication & Strategy Translated complex research findings into clear, actionable policy recommendations for Moroccan policymakers. Co-authored policy briefs and presented results to ministerial-level working groups and international donor forums, directly influencing program reforms.

### Outcome

The Employment Lab became a cornerstone for evidence-based policymaking in Morocco's labor sector.

   Strategic Impact Institutionalized a culture of evidence-based policy design within the Moroccan government, leading to the reallocation of public resources towards programs with proven effectiveness.
   Operational Impact Delivered critical insights that informed the redesign of national employment programs, leading to more efficient and impactful interventions for youth.
   Knowledge Impact Produced several influential research papers and policy briefs, contributing to the global body of knowledge on effective labor market interventions in developing economies.
