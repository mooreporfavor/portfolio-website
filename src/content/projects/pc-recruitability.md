### Problem
The Green Climate Fund needed to optimize its resource allocation to maximize climate impact across a diverse portfolio of developing countries.

### Methodology
Led a quantitative analysis using econometric models to assess the potential impact of various financing instruments. This involved country-level data aggregation, regression analysis, and scenario modeling to forecast outcomes based on different strategic choices.

### Outcome
The analysis directly informed the GCF's updated strategic plan, resulting in a more efficient allocation of over $2 billion in climate financing and a clearer framework for prioritizing future investments.
