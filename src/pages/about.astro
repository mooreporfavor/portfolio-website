            For over two decades, I have been dedicated to driving meaningful impact in international development through rigorous data analysis and economic principles. My career has been a journey through diverse challenges, from evaluating the effectiveness of multi-million dollar development projects to shaping financing strategies for global climate initiatives.

            My core expertise lies at the intersection of leadership, economics, data science, and global infrastructure development. I believe that the most pressing global challenges can only be solved with evidence-based strategies, and I have built my skills around generating that evidence. Whether it's through complex econometric modeling, pragmatic program evaluation, or clear data visualization, my goal is always the same: to provide decision-makers with the clarity they need to act effectively.

            This website itself is a small reflection of my philosophy: a blend of strategic thinking and technical execution. Built with a modern, efficient tech stack, it serves not only as a portfolio of my past work but as a living example of my commitment to continuous learning and applying the right tools to the task at hand.

            When I'm not analyzing data or playing with the latest AI tools, you can find me watching Sevilla Futbol Club or planning my next international adventure.
