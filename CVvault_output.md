#### **Project Deep Dive: Morocco Employability SIB/RBF Pivot Narrative**
*(Multi-faceted narrative of the innovative finance project, adaptable for different audiences)*

*   **Version 1: The Management Consultant Framing (Focus: Agility, Data-Driven Strategy)**
    As the strategic lead for MCC's first major investment in innovative finance, I guided a pioneering Social Impact Bond (SIB) for youth unemployment in Morocco from concept to a formal treaty-level commitment. Post-signature, I initiated an agile validation phase. Market analysis revealed service provider capacity constraints, operational prototyping highlighted high administrative overhead, and financial modeling showed disproportionate transaction costs. Armed with these insights, I built the business case for a strategic pivot, presenting an options analysis to leadership and Moroccan government partners. I successfully managed the change process, securing unanimous approval to re-scope the project into a more streamlined RBF/Outcomes Fund model, demonstrating a commitment to data-driven learning and adaptation.

*   **Version 2: The PPP Specialist Framing (Focus: Deal Structuring, Bankability)**
    I served as the transaction lead for a novel social infrastructure project in Morocco. I led the deal to Commercial Close, achieved when the SIB was embedded within the signed $697.5M U.S.-Morocco Compact. During the subsequent pre-Financial Close due diligence, investor market sounding revealed an unattractive risk-return profile, and a risk allocation analysis showed an inefficient burden on service providers that threatened bankability. Based on this, I architected a post-Commercial Close restructuring of the deal, converting it from a SIB to a direct performance-based contract (RBF). This pragmatic move shifted the project from a P3 to a public-private transaction, retaining the core principle of paying for outcomes while stripping out the unworkable financial architecture to ensure commercial sensibility.

*   **Version 3: The Infrastructure Advisor Framing (Focus: Project Lifecycle, Commercial Optimization)**
    I managed a complex social outcomes project through its entire lifecycle. After the initial SIB concept was approved, my role shifted to overseeing the detailed design and commercial structuring. Our technical due diligence revealed that the "supply chain" of capable service providers was less mature than anticipated and the M&E "utility infrastructure" could not support the required data precision without massive investment. This prompted a value engineering exercise where we determined the core "asset" was the performance incentive, not the complex financing wrapper. I led the post-award refinement to re-scope the project to a direct RBF mechanism—a necessary "change order" based on ground-truth realities that optimized the project for the local context.
