I suspect you're the hiring manager based on your role, so I respect if you'd rather keep your distance, but figured I'd reach out regardless!

Sure enough!  Good to reconnect on here.

You’ll also learn about sushi, from the Edo period up to the present day—and why no one could have eaten the sushi of old with chopsticks. </p>\n\n<p>This course was created by The Great Courses.

0   Cristina  Rojas Proaño  US Peace Corps       Program Manager of Youth Development  Cristina was a pleasure to work for and a pleasure to work with!  Her ability to balance the multiple priorities of her roles with Peace Corps was always impressive: In addition to professionally tending her responsibilities around the office (I never heard a single complaint!), she was able to tailor support to volunteers in the field to make them more effective.  From caring, friendly support for a volunteer having a rough day to a pep talk for a volunteer who needed a gentle nudge, she was always able to manage both the diversity and large numbers of volunteers in her program.  Most impressively, Cristina never seemed to break a sweat in spite of accomplishing so much every day!  04/18/13, 07:36 PM     NaN

From my experience collaborating with Nima in projects both within Krannert and in extracurricular projects, I would trust Nima to thrive in nearly any field to which he set his mind.  Not only is Nima a hard worker and a great team player, but he is genuinely a pleasure to be around personally and professionally.  04/14/09, 09:42 AM     NaN

The promise of clean, causal evidence—a "gold standard" to show us "WHAT WORKS"—was intoxicating. But as I've taken a few steps away from the heart of the "movement" for the last couple years, I've come to worry empirical economists have largely turned themselves into a sect of modern alchemists, so focused on our methods that we mistake the procedural rigor of the tool for true intellectual rigor. I can't claim that analogy as my own, but it has been bouncing around in my head a lot lately.⁣⁣⁣"\n"As a field, our intentions were sound: try to isolate causation to find true "solutions" to poverty (and discard some unworkable solutions). What began as a credible 𝘳𝘦𝘷𝘰𝘭𝘶𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯, however, soon became a new 𝐜𝐡𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐡, complete with its own 𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘥𝘰𝘹𝘺. Fortunately, a handful of precious heretics to this new faith (or perhaps, the true holders of the deeper, more historical tradition?)—figures like Angus Deaton and Lant Pritchett—started pointing out two alchemical flaws in our thinking:⁣⁣⁣"\n""\n" * 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐌𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐜 𝐏𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬. We got stuck in an atheoretical search for "WHAT WORKS" without asking the fundamental economic question of why it works. This reduces development to a series of technical interventions. Unfortunately, one cannot 'intervene' a country into development. Development is a transformative process, a fundamental change in the state of the system, not the sum of a thousand discrete micro-interventions.⁣⁣⁣"\n""\n" * 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐅𝐨𝐨𝐥'𝐬 𝐆𝐨𝐥𝐝. An RCT, at best, proves an intervention worked in one specific place, at one specific time. This success can be like an alchemist's lucky fleck of fool's gold—a result so dependent on unobserved local factors that it's impossible to generalize. Mistaking this local fact for a universal law isn't science; it's wishful thinking... Or to continue the metaphor, an act of faith.⁣⁣⁣"\n""\n"RCTs are a powerful and essential instrument for answering certain questions. But they have taken up all the oxygen. The great irony is that in the quest for causal purity, our field began to neglect the very tools that make it so powerful. This isn't just a methodological narrowing; it's a departure from our roots. The foundational works of political economy (Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Adam Smith) weren't a series of controlled trials or econometric attributions; they were grand syntheses of history, observation, and theory—our field's foundational strengths."\n""\n"​After all, what good is a "gold standard" if all it does is certify 24 KARAT FOOL'S GOLD"\n"       NaN      NaN  MEMBER_NETWORK
